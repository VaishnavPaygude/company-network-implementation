# 🏢 Company Network Implementation

**Tool:** Cisco Packet Tracer  

## 📜 Project Overview
This project showcases the design and implementation of a **multi-branch corporate network** with VLAN segmentation, structured IP addressing, and integrated enterprise services.  
The network supports both **wired** and **wireless** connectivity for smooth business operations.

## 🗺️ Network Layout
The network includes:
- Multiple branch offices
- VLAN segmentation for department-wise isolation
- Routers, switches, trunk links, and wireless routers
- Centralized FTP, Web, and DNS servers

## ⚙️ Features & Configurations
- **VLANs** for secure departmental separation.
- **Router-on-a-Stick** for inter-VLAN communication.
- **Static & Dynamic Routing** for efficient data flow.
- **Structured IP Addressing** for simplified management.
- **Server Integration**:
  - FTP Server for file sharing
  - Web Server for hosting services
  - DNS Server for domain resolution
- **Network Security** measures on switches and routers.
- **Connectivity Verification** using `ping` and `traceroute`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)
- Router-on-a-Stick
- Static & Dynamic Routing
- IP Addressing
- Server Configuration (FTP, Web, DNS)
- TCP/IP Protocols
- Wireless Networking


## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Load the `company_network.pkt` file.
3. Explore and verify device configurations.
4. Test connectivity using:
   ```bash
   ping <destination_IP>
   traceroute <destination_IP>
